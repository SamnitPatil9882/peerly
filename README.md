# The Peer Rewards and Recognition System 

Peerly is peer-recognision and rewarding system! Every employee gets and gives 'high-5' (henceforth called hi5)
Give a hi5 to someone who you want to appreciate for something they did.
**Every week you get 2 hi5 that you can give to others - use it or lose it.**

# Giving a hi5

A hi5 can be given to anyone in the company if you want to appreciate his/her actions.
The action must be one of the Core Values of the company. 
Obviously, you must choose a person.
There must be a mandatory reason for this hi5 which must explain why you are appreciating the person.

All your hi5 are publicly visible to all. Others can give additional hi5 to the same person for the same activity. 
You can also flag someone else's recognition if you think it's not correct. (see Moderation below).

All these "Core Values" are configurable! 

# Badges and Rewards

As you collect hi5, you are also automatically collecting badges for consistency, activeness, in-activeness, giving and getting! 
Examples:

* Person-1 gets 25 hi5 in the month-1 and is the leader for the month! This person gets a "Leader" badge with a counter in it which says 1.
* Person-2 gets more than 5 hi5 in consecutive 6 weeks. This person collects a "Consistency" badge to his/her name.
* If you get hi5 with "Blogger" core value for 3 weeks in a row, you get a "Writer" badge.
* If a person gets a "Qualtity" core value for 4 weeks in a row, you get a "Quality" badge

Over time, we may see something like this:

* Person-1 - Leader badge with number "3" in it, a "Guru" badge and a "Sharp Shooter" badge
* Person-2 - "Quality" badge, "Red Beret" badge, "Party" badge!

(Note: We can use ideas from the Indian Army ribbons and insignia and also from various games for badges, ribbons etc.)

At the end of the month, ALL badges awarded can get an optional monetary reward from the company! 
This could be a gift voucher or cash or a gift. 

# Moderation

A moderator views all the hi5 flagged as "Fraud", "Not Relevant", "Incorrect" and either deletes these recognitions or asks for clarification.
These can be reviewed later via reports. 

# Reports

Collection of data is critical. This tells us the pulse of the company! 

* Number of stars received over a period
* Number of stars given over a period
* Number of high-5's received  over a period
* How many people have only given stars but have received very few?
* How many people have received a lot of stars but given very few?
* Which day of the week are stars and high-5s given the most? 
* Flagged Recognition report (Later, we can add some machine-learning flow to auto-flag recognition or prevent fraud)

# Leaderboard and Profiles

This is the current month's leaderboards with the count of hi5 received in this month (and probably the daily delta). 

Each Persons Profile will be with the badges they have earned. So, over a year, we have a good set of badges and ribbons!
